# Troubleshooting Guide for CareBox with Hall Effect Sensors

## Random LED Blinking Issue - FIXED

The issue with random LED blinking was caused by:

1. **Pin Conflict**: Both the buzzer and one of the green LED pins were assigned to GPIO 32, causing them to interfere with each other. This has been fixed by reassigning the green LED to GPIO 33.

2. **Hall Effect Sensor Reading Frequency**: Checking the Hall Effect sensors too frequently (every 100ms) could lead to noise and false readings. This has been adjusted to a 300ms interval.

## Linear Hall Effect Module Working as a Switch

The Hall Effect sensor is now configured to work like a simple switch:

1. **Magnet Present (South pole) = Lid CLOSED**: 
   - Digital output (D0) will be HIGH when the magnet is present
   - In Wokwi, slide the "Magnet" control to around 80 to simulate lid closed

2. **No Magnet = Lid OPEN**:
   - Digital output (D0) will be LOW when the magnet is removed
   - In Wokwi, slide the "Magnet" control to around 0 to simulate lid open

## Adjusting Sensitivity in Wokwi

The "Sensitivity" control simulates turning the potentiometer on the physical KY-024 module:

1. **Higher Sensitivity** (move slider toward 100):
   - Makes the sensor more sensitive to magnetic fields
   - The lid will be detected as "closed" even with a weaker magnetic field

2. **Lower Sensitivity** (move slider toward 0):
   - Makes the sensor less sensitive to magnetic fields
   - Requires a stronger magnetic field to detect the lid as "closed"

## Testing Hall Effect Sensors

The `testHallSensors()` function has been enhanced to provide better visual feedback:

- **GREEN LED**: Indicates the lid is CLOSED (magnet detected)
- **RED LED**: Indicates the lid is OPEN (no magnet detected)

## How to Use in Wokwi

1. Add your custom chip to the Wokwi project
2. Connect pins:
   - VCC to 3.3V
   - GND to ground
   - D0 to your input pins (25, 26, 27)
3. To simulate lid closing:
   - Move "Magnet" slider to around 80
4. To simulate lid opening:
   - Move "Magnet" slider to around 0
5. Adjust sensitivity as needed with the "Sensitivity" slider

## Debug Messages

The chip now provides more verbose debug messages in the Wokwi console:
- State changes (lid open/closed)
- Threshold adjustments when sensitivity changes
- Analog readings and thresholds

This should make it easier to understand what's happening with the Hall Effect sensor and troubleshoot any issues.
