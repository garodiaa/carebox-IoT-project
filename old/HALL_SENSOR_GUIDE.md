# Hall Effect Sensor Implementation Guide

## Hardware Setup for Real-World CareBox

This guide explains how to implement Hall Effect sensors for the CareBox project with real hardware. The `fifth.c` file has been created by taking the best parts of both `fourth.c` and `second.c`.

### Hall Effect Sensor Logic

In real hardware (KY-024 or KY-003 modules):

1. **When lid is CLOSED (magnet present)**:
   - Digital output is **LOW (0)**
   - System is in standby mode (no LED)

2. **When lid is OPENED (magnet away)**:
   - Digital output is **HIGH (1)**
   - System registers medicine was taken
   - LEDs indicate action (GREEN for medicine taken)

### Key Differences from Previous Versions

1. **Removed Simulation-Specific Code**:
   - No more Wokwi-specific settings or comments
   - All logic is set for real hardware behavior

2. **Correct Logic Implementation**:
   - Lid CLOSED = LOW reading
   - Lid OPEN = HIGH reading

3. **Better Debouncing**:
   - Simple software debouncing ensures stable readings
   - Prevents false triggers when the lid is at the edge position

4. **Proper State Tracking**:
   - Previous state is tracked correctly to detect changes
   - Initial state is read from sensors during setup

### Installation Tips

1. **Mounting the Sensors**:
   - Mount Hall Effect sensors on the CareBox frame
   - Position them where the lid will close directly above them

2. **Magnet Placement**:
   - Attach small magnets to the underside of each lid
   - Ensure the magnet aligns with the sensor when closed

3. **Sensitivity Adjustment**:
   - If using KY-024 modules, adjust the potentiometer for sensitivity
   - Test opening/closing the lid to confirm reliable detection

### Testing Your Implementation

1. Use the built-in `testHallSensors()` function
2. Open and close each lid to verify proper state changes
3. Set an alarm and verify it clears when opening the appropriate lid

With this implementation, your CareBox will reliably detect when compartments are opened or closed in real-world hardware conditions.
