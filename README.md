### Visual Indicators
- **RGB LED System**: Individual LEDs for each of the 3 compartments
- **Color-Coded Status**: Different colors indicate various system states
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate visual response to user actions

### Multi-Channel Notifications
- **Mobile Alerts**: Blynk app notifications sent to smartphone
- **Audio Alerts**: Buzzer provides audible reminders
- **LCD Display**: Local status display with time and next alarm info
- **Terminal Logging**: Real-time status messages and history

### Flexible Scheduling
- **Multiple Alarms**: Up to 3 alarms per compartment (9 total)
- **Weekly Scheduling**: Day-of-week selection for each alarm
- **Individual Medicine Names**: Custom labels for each compartment
- **Upcoming Warnings**: 30-minute advance notifications

## Getting Started

### Quick Setup Checklist
1. **Hardware Assembly**
   - Follow HARDWARE_SETUP_GUIDE.md
   - Verify all connections match pin assignments
   - Test individual components

2. **Software Configuration**
   - Follow SOFTWARE_SETUP_GUIDE.md
   - Install required libraries
   - Configure WiFi and Blynk credentials

3. **System Testing**
   - Upload code to ESP32
   - Verify startup sequence
   - Test hall sensors and LEDs

4. **User Setup**
   - Follow USER_GUIDE.md
   - Configure medicine names and alarm times
   - Test complete alarm cycle

### Required Skills
- **Basic Electronics**: Understanding of breadboard connections
- **Arduino Programming**: Familiarity with Arduino IDE
- **Mobile Apps**: Basic Blynk app usage
- **Troubleshooting**: Ability to use serial monitor for debugging

## System Behavior

### Normal Operation Cycle
1. **Standby**: All LEDs off, system monitoring time
2. **Upcoming Alarm**: Blue blinking LED 30 minutes before due time
3. **Active Alarm**: Red blinking LED + buzzer when medicine is due
4. **Acknowledgment**: Blue solid LED when lid is opened
5. **Completion**: LED off when lid is closed, cycle repeats

### Error Handling
- **Network Issues**: Local alarms continue, no remote notifications
- **Power Loss**: RTC maintains time, requires restart for full functionality  
- **Sensor Errors**: Individual compartments can fail independently
- **Component Failure**: System designed for graceful degradation
