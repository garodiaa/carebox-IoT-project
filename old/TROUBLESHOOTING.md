# Hall Effect Sensor and Alarm Troubleshooting Guide

## Recent Fix Applied

I've made two important changes to your CareBox code to ensure alarms turn off correctly when you open a compartment:

1. **Improved debouncing** - Extended the debounce delay from 5ms to 20ms and added debug output to help track sensor state changes.
2. **Force alarm deactivation** - Added code to ensure ALL alarms for a compartment are cleared when the lid is opened, regardless of previous state.

## How to Test the Fix

1. **Set up an alarm** for the current time
2. **Wait for the alarm to activate** - LED will blink RED and buzzer will sound
3. **Open the compartment** - Change Magnet slider from 100 to 0 (simulating lid open)
4. **Verify alarm stops** - LED should change to GREEN and buzzer should stop

## Common Issues and Solutions

### If alarm still persists:

1. **Check Serial Monitor** - Look for debugging info showing sensor readings
   - You should see: `[DEBUG] Hall Sensor X: Reading=0, PreviousState=1`
   - This confirms the sensor registered the state change

2. **Try cycling the sensor more dramatically**:
   - First set Magnet to 100 (fully closed)
   - Then set Magnet to 0 (fully open)
   - This ensures a clean transition between states

3. **Check the sensitivity setting** as outlined in the WOKWI_HALL_EFFECT_SETTINGS.md guide:
   - If the readings are inconsistent, adjust Sensitivity to 50 (middle value)
   - Readings should be stable and reliable after adjustment

### Understanding Hall Effect Sensor Readings

- **HIGH (1)** = Magnetic field detected = LID CLOSED
- **LOW (0)** = No magnetic field = LID OPEN

When you change the Magnet slider from 100 to 0, the reading should change from HIGH to LOW.

## What's Happening Behind the Scenes

When a compartment is opened (sensor reads LOW):
1. The system identifies which compartment has been opened
2. ALL active reminders for that compartment are forcefully cleared
3. The LED changes from RED (alarm) to GREEN (acknowledged)
4. The buzzer stops sounding

The fix I've implemented ensures that all reminder states are reset when a compartment is opened, which should resolve the issue of persistent alarms.
