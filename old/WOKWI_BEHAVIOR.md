# Hall Effect Sensor Behavior in Wokwi Simulation

## Understanding the Sensor Behavior

After reviewing the `linear-hall-effect-chip.c` file from your Wokwi simulation, I've updated the code to match the actual behavior of the hall effect sensor in the simulation.

### How the Simulated Hall Effect Sensor Works

The simulated hall effect sensor in Wokwi behaves as follows:

```c
// For simplicity in the CareBox project:
// - Strong South field (>50): Digital HIGH (lid closed)
// - Weak or no field (<50): Digital LOW (lid open)
if (value >= 50) {
  chip->digital_value = true;  // HIGH when magnet is present (lid closed)
  printf("Strong magnetic field: Lid CLOSED (D0=HIGH)\n");
} else {
  chip->digital_value = false; // LOW when no magnet (lid open)
  printf("Weak/no magnetic field: Lid OPEN (D0=LOW)\n");
}
```

This is the opposite of what we had previously implemented.

## Correct Behavior

| Lid State | Magnet Value | Sensor Reading | Threshold LED | CareBox LED |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|---------------|------------|
| **CLOSED** | 50-100 | **HIGH (1)** | **ON** | **OFF** (normal) |
| **OPEN** | 0-49 | **LOW (0)** | **OFF** | **BLUE** |

## Important Details

1. **When lid is CLOSED (magnet value 50-100)**:
   - The sensor outputs HIGH (1)
   - The threshold LED on the hall effect sensor is ON
   - The CareBox LED remains OFF (normal state)
   - Normal operation continues (alarms can be active)

2. **When lid is OPEN (magnet value 0-49)**:
   - The sensor outputs LOW (0)
   - The threshold LED on the hall effect sensor is OFF
   - The CareBox LED turns BLUE and stays blue while lid is open
   - Any active alarms are cleared

## Testing

1. Set the "Magnet" slider to 80-100 to simulate LID CLOSED
   - You should see HIGH reading in the serial monitor
   - No blue LED on the CareBox

2. Set the "Magnet" slider to 0-40 to simulate LID OPEN
   - You should see LOW reading in the serial monitor
   - Blue LED on the CareBox turns on
   - Alarms should clear if any were active

The code has been updated to match this behavior exactly as it works in the Wokwi simulation.
