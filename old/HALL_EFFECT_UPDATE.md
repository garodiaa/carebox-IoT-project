# Hall Effect Sensor Logic Update

## Important Changes Made

I've updated the Hall Effect sensor logic to match what's actually happening in your Wokwi simulation. The issue was that the Hall Effect sensor in Wokwi is behaving opposite to what your code expected:

### Before:
- **HIGH (1)** was expected when magnet is present (lid closed)
- **LOW (0)** was expected when magnet is absent (lid open)

### Actual behavior in Wokwi:
- **LOW (0)** is what you get when magnet is present (lid closed, magnet=100)
- **HIGH (1)** is what you get when magnet is absent (lid open, magnet=0)

## Key changes:
1. Changed initial hall effect sensor state to LOW (closed lid position)
2. Flipped the logic in the detection code
3. Updated all comments to reflect the actual behavior in Wokwi
4. Updated the test functions to report the correct states

## How to use the CareBox now:
1. When setting up the simulation, all compartments should show **LOW** readings initially (lids closed)
2. To simulate opening a lid:
   - Change the Hall Effect "Magnet" slider from 100 to 0
   - You should see the reading change from LOW to HIGH
   - The system will detect this as a lid opening

3. To simulate closing a lid:
   - Change the Hall Effect "Magnet" slider from 0 to 100
   - You should see the reading change from HIGH to LOW
   - The system will detect this as a lid closing

## Testing
To test if this fix worked:
1. Set up an alarm for the current time
2. When the alarm activates, change the magnet from 100 to 0
3. The alarm should stop and the LED should turn green

The debug output will now show the correct relationship between the magnet settings and the lid state.
